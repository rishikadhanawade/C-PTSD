Performing EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) on your own requires a basic understanding of the process, but for complex trauma and deep-rooted emotional issues, it’s highly recommended to work with a trained therapist. However, for self-guided EMDR-inspired techniques, here’s how you can approach it:

 Steps for EMDR-Inspired Self-Help

 1. Identify the Target Memory
   - Start by identifying the specific memory or incident that you believe led to your current distress. In your case, it could be a particular incident of stonewalling or the feeling of rejection and isolation when your parents gave you the silent treatment.
   - Focus on one memory at a time for effective processing.

 2. Rate the Distress (SUD Scale)
   - Rate how disturbing the memory feels on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no distress and 10 being extreme distress. This is called the Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD) scale.
   - This rating will help you monitor progress as you work through the memory.

 3. Identify the Negative Belief
   - Identify the negative belief about yourself that is connected to the memory. This might be something like:
     - “I’m not good enough.”
     - “People won’t love me unless I please them.”
     - “If I make mistakes, I’ll be rejected.”

 4. Identify the Positive Belief
   - Now, think of a positive belief you want to believe about yourself in place of the negative one, but that doesn’t fully feel true yet. For example:
     - “I am worthy of love and acceptance.”
     - “It’s okay to prioritize my needs.”
     - “Making mistakes doesn’t mean I will be rejected.”

 5. Visualize the Disturbing Memory
   - Bring the memory to mind—the specific event of stonewalling or rejection.
   - Allow yourself to feel the emotions and sensations associated with that memory. Don’t push them away, but let them surface.
   
 6. Perform Bilateral Stimulation
   EMDR uses bilateral stimulation (BLS) to help process the memory. For self-help, you can use tapping or eye movements:
   
   For Eye Movements:
   - Move your eyes from left to right, about 20-30 times, while holding the memory and emotions in mind. You can:
     - Move your eyes between two fixed points (e.g., your fingers held about 12 inches apart).
     - Follow an object like a pen or your finger.

   For Tapping:
   - Alternatively, you can tap left and right sides of your body (e.g., tapping on your knees or shoulders) in an alternating pattern.
   - Tap for about 30 seconds while staying focused on the memory.

 7. Pause and Take a Deep Breath
   - After each round of eye movements or tapping, pause, take a deep breath, and see what comes up. You may notice a shift in how you feel about the memory.
   - Notice any changes in emotions, thoughts, or body sensations.

 8. Rate Your Distress Again
   - Reassess your distress on the SUD scale. Has the intensity gone down? If it’s still high, continue with more rounds of eye movements or tapping.
   
 9. Introduce the Positive Belief
   - Once the distress has reduced, focus on your positive belief (“I am worthy of love and acceptance,” for example).
   - Visualize yourself feeling that positive belief and notice how your body feels when you say it to yourself.
   - While focusing on the positive belief, repeat another round of eye movements or tapping for 20-30 seconds.

 10. Conclude and Reflect
   - When you feel calmer and more settled, take a moment to reflect on any new insights or feelings that came up during the process.
   - You might want to journal about the experience to track your progress.

 Important Tips:
- Stay Safe: If at any point the process feels too overwhelming or distressing, stop and ground yourself with calming techniques (e.g., deep breathing, mindfulness).
- Pacing: Do not rush. Start with smaller or less intense memories if you're doing this on your own.
- Seek Professional Help: If you find certain memories or emotions too difficult to process on your own, it's important to seek help from a therapist trained in EMDR.
